# CRIBS

*A new perspective to design*

> Cribs is a website created for a fictional company **Cribs**. I designed and developed it for a friend and it was a great learning experience.

## How The Project Is Set Up

* ##### `dist`  folder

   contains the minified code

  * ğŸ“¦dist
   â”£ ğŸ“‚css
   â”£ ğŸ“‚img
   â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚vendors
   â”— ğŸ“‚js

* ##### `src`  folder

   contains the source files

   * ğŸ“¦src
      â”£ ğŸ“‚js
      â”— ğŸ“‚sass
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚abstracts
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚base
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚components
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚pages
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œabout.scss
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œfaq.scss
      â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œmain.scss
      â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œprojects.scss
   
   The `components` subfolder holds all potentially reusable parts of the site and can exist independently. These can be copied and pasted anywhere even in a different project, provided the corresponding class is added to the `HTML`.

* ##### root  files

   *  â”£ ğŸ“œabout.html
      â”£ ğŸ“œcribs-screenshot.png
      â”£ ğŸ“œfaq.html
      â”£ ğŸ“œfavicon.ico
      â”£ ğŸ“œindex.html
      â”£ ğŸ“œprojects.html
      â”— ğŸ“œREADME.md
